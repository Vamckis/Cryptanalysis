# Cryptanalysis

## Cryptography
- It is a process of creating hidden data.
- Key Terminology:
  - Encryption: Scramble data to protect it from unauthorised access.
  - Decryption
  - Cipher: Encryption algorithm
  - Interception: Attacker can cut communication and redirect messages to themselves.
  - Eaves dropping
  - Manipulation
- Notations:
  - EK(M) = C (E: Encryption, K: Key, M: Message)
  - DK(C) = M (D: Decryption, C: Ciphertest)
- 3 states of data:
  - Data at Rest : Data in Harddisk (Encryption can be used)
  - Data in Transit: Data sent over network (Encryption can be used)
  - Data in Process : Data in memory (We cannot use Encryption effectively)

### Symmetric ciphers
### Asymmetric ciphers
